# Privacy Policy
This policy is effective and last updated on 18/07/2021.

Talia source code (the "Program") is a [discord](https://discord.com) bot which provides services through discord messages.
This document outlines what information the Program collects, and how the Program uses it.
Talia Team ("we" or "us") is only responsible for information collected in the "main" database (the "Database"), which is owned and controlled by whoever owns us.
We only control the "main" discord bot account (account ID: 840430636422266910) (the "Bot") and we are not responsible for any other bot accounts using the Program.
Any discord legal documentation is applicable here.

## Information we collect
Any time users of the Bot ("you") add the Bot to a discord server or send a message in a server that has the Bot in it, this privacy policy may apply.

- **Information you provide**: When a message is sent in any server that has the Bot, we may temporarily cache or store content of that message.
This content can include (but is not limited to); message content, embed content and attachment content.
Any views expressed in messages that are cached or stored may not be expressed by us.

- **Information we collect automatically**: When you interact with the Bot, we may collect and store information such as server ID and user ID.
We may also temporarily cache other publicly available information, all of which is done by [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) which uses the [discord API](https://discord.com/developers).

## Where information is processed
We, and the Bot are based in Canada.
No matter where you are located, by using the Bot, you consent to the processing and transferring of your information in and to Canada.
All Canadian law applies.

## The use of your information
We use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. This information is used to customize and elevate your experience when using the Bot. Any server ID or user ID's that are stored are used to define your position in the Database.
